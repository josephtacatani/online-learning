        <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
        <p>
          Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed
          to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
          application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), meaning that
          compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need
          for recompilation.
